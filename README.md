# move-copy-files

This script is designed to quickly move/copy any file of your choice with high speed. It can replace the Windows search function, particularly for handling multiple file extensions such as jpg, png, and more (as Windows search only supports one at a time). The script utilizes PowerShell, so it's advisable to explore other PowerShell scripts for reference. Please note that this project is not actively maintained.
